# Tic..Tac...LOL ‚è∞

A program that remind you to check your map on League of legends.  
Inspired by the video of [sididi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3GGIp9K3wM)

## Why ?

I was trying to improve at league of legends and after visioning this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3GGIp9K3wM)  
i started train to check my map every 15sec with another random video on youtube who make a beep every 15 seconds  
but there was multiple problem:

- The videos i found stopped after 30min so if the game was too long i have to alt tab and replay
- It was annoying each time to search for the video before each sessions
- In [sididi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3GGIp9K3wM) he say to start with a 15 seconds reminder then 10 and 5 at the end  
i have to find 3 video with a beep with these interval ? Really annoying ü§î (Yeah i'm a really lazy person)
